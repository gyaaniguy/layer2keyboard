# Layer 2 Intro 


Autohotkey script that adds an extra 'layer' to the keyboard.
In layer 2, a key can be set to press some other key or a macro
This is meant to emulate the behaviour of 60% keyboards. In addition text macro's can be set. Useful to avoid typing repetitive stuff - "your name" "Thank you" etc.
All keys and macros functions can be easily configured. 

## Switching between layers

Press Alt to switch from/to layer 2. Can be changed to Shift/Caps/Ctrl



## Example use cases: 

1. Emulate function keys with number row. F* 
Key '1' in layer 2 will send F1 
Key '2' in layer 2 will send F2 
and so on

2. Easy access to Play/Pause and other media keys
Key 'z' in layer 2 will Play Previous
Key 'x' in layer 2 will send Play/Pause
Key 'c' in layer 2 will Play Next

3. Emulate Arrow Keys to reduce hand movement

i,j,k,l are set as up,left,down,right keys. After getting used to this, your overall productivity will increase.
